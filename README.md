1. readme.md
2. QIIME2_SETUP.py - Installs miniconda and qiime2
3. full-table.qza - generated from fastq files (Olson 2018 )using dada2 denoise-paired
4. rep-seqs.qza - generated from fastq files (Olson 2018 )using dada2 denoise-paired
5. stats.qza - generated from fastq files (Olson 2018 )using dada2 denoise-paired
6. HITS_Microbiome_Discovery.ipynb - Colab notebook used to conduct qiime2 analysis
