This repository is the starting point for 16s amplicon analysis of the data used in the cell paper "The Gut Microbiota Mediates the Anti-Seizure Effects of the Ketogenic Diet"(Olson 2018). It contains the following files: 
1. README.md - the file you are currently reading
2. QIIME2_SETUP.py - Installs miniconda and qiime2
3. full-table.qza - generated from fastq files (Olson 2018 )using dada2 denoise-paired
4. rep-seqs.qza - generated from fastq files (Olson 2018 )using dada2 denoise-paired
5. stats.qza - generated from fastq files (Olson 2018 )using dada2 denoise-paired
6. HITS_Microbiome_Discovery.ipynb - Colab notebook used to conduct qiime2 analysis
